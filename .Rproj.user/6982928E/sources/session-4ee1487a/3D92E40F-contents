                  The challenges of Ph.D. students inspired a group of friends and colleagues at the TechTalent-Lab and the Department of Management of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya·BarcelonaTech to organize a series of "Ph.D. day in Management" regarding research topics. Thus, these events aim to support Ph.D. students by providing them training, advice, and expertise from top scholars. It is the perfect opportunity to learn from experts and present your research while discussing your doubts. It has been designed to increase Ph.D. candidates' effectiveness and meet the challenges of early-career researchers.

                  This year's first edition will focus on the interdisciplinary research field of qualitative methods, which is pivotal in management research due to its in-depth and holistic approach to understanding complex human and organizational phenomena. Qualitative research is invaluable in this field because allows us to understand human behavior, identify contextual insights better than quantitative methods, conduct exploratory research in new areas, and generate theories to explain new phenomena.

                  The event will be hosted on Zoom. The registration is open and accessible for all Ph.D. students in the research field of Management and related fields. Feel free to share this information!

                  The Ph.D. day is an event organized for Ph.D. students. Due to its training and supportive nature, it offers the opportunity to Ph.D. candidates to present their research to a panel of experts and gather relevant feedback on their research and presentation skills.

                  The dynamic of the presentation will be somehow innovative. First, each participant will have 5 minutes to present their research work and ask two questions (i.e., doubts they may have) to the expert panel. Then, two members of the expert panel will answer them.

                <p class="lead">               
                  Apart from the direct feedback, all presenters will receive a written report regarding their presentation. It will be grounded on the five experts' opinions and the feedback from the attendants.

                  <p class="lead">               
                  We consider that this approach will help Ph.D. students to receive feedback tailored to their expectations, to resolve their particular doubts, and to receive an assessment of their work without the stress of receiving it live.
